### *Building Energy Efficiency Prediction Model*
## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the energy efficiency rating of buildings using supervised learning techniques. As part of an architecture firm, the goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts the energy efficiency of buildings based on various features such as wall area, roof area, overall height, and more.

## Project Scenario
You are a member of an architecture firm tasked with creating a predictive model for estimating the energy efficiency of buildings. This model will assist architects and engineers in designing energy-efficient structures by providing insights into the potential energy performance of different building designs.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the predictive model contains information about various building features and their corresponding energy efficiency ratings. Features include:

Wall area
Roof area
Overall height
Glazing area
Glazing area distribution
Orientation
Compactness
Surface area
Wall and roof material
Relative compactness
The target variable is the energy efficiency rating, which is typically measured on a scale indicating the energy consumption of the building.

## Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering if necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the relationships between different features and the energy efficiency rating. Visualize the data to gain insights.
Model Selection: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting to identify the best-performing model.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the chosen model to improve its performance further.
Deployment: Deploy the trained model in a production environment where it can be used to predict the energy efficiency rating of new building designs.

## Usage
